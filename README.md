# Overview

This is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses functional programming principles. The game can be started by calling the main:start() function and then the game will prompt the user to provide input based on what game mode they would like to play (single or multi player mode), and what position they would like to go on the tic-tac-toe board. The game will automatically end once any game ending condition have been met.

The purpose for writing this software was for me to learn more about how to program using a functional programming language like Erlang.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Visual Studio Code, Erlang, Git, and GitHub.

I used Erlang as my programming language for this program.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to do the following to this program:
* Utilize randomness for the tic-tac-toe robot
* Make the computers algorithm more efficient
* Edit the code to use less case of code blocks
